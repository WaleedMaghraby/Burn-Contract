# Biconomy Relayer Network Contracts 

The [BRN (Biconomy Relayer Network)](https://forum.biconomy.io/t/biconomy-relayer-network-general-design/446) aims to address the challenges associated with organizing a group of relayers in a blockchain environment. The main idea is to create a mechanism where independent relayers can collaborate and provide relaying services in a more organized and reliable manner.


While individual relayers can perform this task on their own, the BRN proposes that applications benefit from being supported by a group of independent relayers. This collective approach ensures greater system reliability, as even if one relayer fails, the others can maintain the operability of the system.

The challenges faced in organizing a group of relayers include:

1. Integration with different applications: The BRN needs to integrate with various applications that require transaction relaying services seamlessly. This integration should be smooth and efficient, allowing applications to leverage the benefits of the relayer network.
2. Competition among peers: Since multiple relayers may be part of the network, there can be competition among them for relaying transactions. This challenge must be addressed to ensure fair and efficient transaction relaying without favoring any specific relayer.
3. Transaction management: Managing and coordinating transactions within the relayer network is crucial. There may be a need for protocols and mechanisms to handle transaction verification, sequencing, and other related tasks to maintain the integrity and consistency of the blockchain.
4. Reimbursement: Relayers provide their services, and it is essential to establish a fair reimbursement mechanism. This involves determining how relayers are compensated for their efforts and ensuring that the incentives are aligned for active participation and continued support of the network.

To overcome these challenges, the BRN is built with three core components:

1. Smart Contract Core: This component includes the smart contracts that define the rules and logic of the relayer network. It governs the interaction between applications and relayers, ensuring proper integration and coordination.
2. Application Management Contracts: These contracts handle the integration of different applications with the relayer network. They facilitate the onboarding of applications, define the requirements for relaying transactions, and provide necessary interfaces for application-relayer interaction.
3. Relayer Node: This component represents the independent relayers that form the network. Relayer nodes execute the relaying tasks, verify transactions, and contribute to the overall operability of the blockchain system. They interact with the smart contract core and application management contracts to fulfill their role effectively.

By combining these components, the BRN aims to create a collaborative and reliable environment for transaction relaying in blockchain applications, addressing the challenges of integration, competition, transaction management, and reimbursement.
